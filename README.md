# Snapchat Redesign
Minimalist approach to a redesign of Snapchat's Login / Signup screens written entirely in Swift

## Login / Signup Screen

Utilizes AVCaptureSession to render the back-facing camera's view as the login/signup background view. User can toggle between the login and signup screen by swiping left/right.

#### Installation

* Clone repo and run ```pod install``` in order to import the necessary libraries/frameworks
* Must be run on personal device. Capture Session cannot be used on iOS Simulator.
